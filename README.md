### Wireframes & Design Process

The design process for this project followed a user-centered approach, focusing on simplicity, ease of navigation, and responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.

#### Design Process

1. **Wireframing**:  
   The first step in the design process was creating wireframes for key pages (Article Page, Home Page, Login Page, and Register Page). These wireframes helped visualize the basic layout of the site before development, allowing for clear planning of where elements like navigation, content, and user interactions would be placed.

2. **Responsive Design**:  
   One of the primary goals was to ensure that the layout adapts well to various screen sizes, from large desktop screens to smaller mobile devices. The wireframes reflect this with a focus on how elements like navigation menus, forms, and content blocks should behave on different devices.

3. **Consistency**:  
   Consistent use of fonts, colors, and layouts was emphasized to ensure that users would have a cohesive experience across all pages. The design keeps a clean look with simple navigation, making it easy for users to access and interact with posts.

4. **User Flow**:  
   The wireframes aimed to make the user flow intuitive, with clear calls to action on pages like the Home and Article pages. The Login and Register pages were designed to be straightforward, with minimal distractions, allowing users to quickly sign up or log in to interact with the platform.

5. **Feedback and Iteration**:  
   The initial wireframes were revised based on feedback to improve usability and accessibility. For example, button placements and font sizes were adjusted to improve navigation on smaller screens.

10. **Font Awesome**: A library for adding scalable vector icons, enhancing the website's UI with icons for navigation and interaction.

## Development Process

The development of the News Forum application followed the **Agile methodology**, which emphasizes iterative development and continuous feedback. This approach allowed for flexibility in adjusting features based on feedback and ensured the project met the intended goals efficiently.

Key components of the Agile process included:

1. **GitHub Issues**:
   - GitHub Issues was used as the primary tool for tracking tasks and managing user stories.
   - Each user story or task was logged as an issue, assigned a priority, and linked to relevant commits for easy tracking and collaboration.

2. **Continuous Integration & Deployment**:
   - The project was continuously integrated into a version control system (Git), with all code being pushed to a GitHub repository.
   - Heroku was used for deployment, ensuring that the live version of the application was updated after each successful merge to the main branch.

3. **Continuous Evaluation**:
   - Since the project timeline was limited, a formal sprint process was not used. Instead, I continuously evaluated the development progress.
   - Regular assessments were made to identify what was working well and what required improvement. This approach allowed for quick adjustments and ensured the project stayed on track.

By following this Agile methodology, the project was developed in a structured yet flexible manner, allowing for consistent progress while accommodating changes as needed.

## Security Enhancements

The News Forum application implements several key security features to ensure the protection of user data and to mitigate common web security vulnerabilities:

1. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**:
   - Djangoâ€™s built-in CSRF protection has been enabled to prevent unauthorized commands being executed on behalf of an authenticated user.
   - This is especially important in forms where users submit sensitive data, such as login information or comments.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**:
   - By using Django's templating engine, the application automatically escapes potentially harmful HTML or JavaScript, protecting against XSS attacks.
   - User inputs are sanitized before being rendered in the browser.

3. **Secure Cookies**:
   - The application configures session and CSRF cookies to be sent over secure connections (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`), ensuring these cookies are only transmitted via HTTPS in production.

4. **SSL/HTTPS in Production**:
   - When deployed on Heroku, the application enforces HTTPS using Djangoâ€™s `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` setting, which ensures that all traffic is encrypted between the user and the server.
   - This guarantees that sensitive information, such as login credentials, are securely transmitted.
   
5. **Local Development**:
   - For local development, `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` are disabled to allow ease of testing without needing HTTPS.
   - This ensures a flexible development environment while keeping security tight in production.

6. **Environment Variables**:
   - Sensitive information such as `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials, and email settings are stored securely in environment variables and not hardcoded into the project.
   - This protects these values from being exposed in the version control system.

By implementing these security measures, the News Forum application ensures that user data is protected, both in local development and in production environments on Heroku.

## Testing

### Unit Testing

The News Forum application includes unit tests to verify the functionality of models, views, and forms. These tests are essential to ensure that the core features, such as post creation, comment functionality, and user authentication, work as intended.

To run the unit tests, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   ```

### Manual Testing

In addition to unit tests, the following manual tests were conducted:

#### User Authentication:
- Verified that users can successfully sign up, log in, and log out.
- Ensured that only authenticated users can create posts or leave comments.

#### Post and Comment Management:
- Tested creating, editing, and deleting posts and comments.
- Ensured that only the author of a post or comment can edit or delete it.

#### Responsive Design:
- Tested the application across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure it remains fully functional and visually consistent.

### Bugs and Unresolved Issues

#### Password Reset Functionality:
- The password reset feature is currently not functioning as expected. Although the application attempts to send reset emails through Gmailâ€™s SMTP service, there is an unresolved issue related to SMTP authentication with Googleâ€™s service.
- The error encountered is likely due to incorrect or missing configuration of an app-specific password for the email account in use. Google may block access due to its security settings.
- This issue is still being investigated, and users are unable to reset their passwords at this time.

### Validator Testing

#### HTML/CSS Validation:
- The HTML and CSS code was validated using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure compliance with web standards.

#### Python Validation:
- The Python code was validated against PEP8 standards using `flake8` to ensure proper code formatting and consistency.

### Running Tests Locally
